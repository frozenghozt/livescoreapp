## LiveScore (React + Redux + External API)

Live webapp: https://livescoreapp.netlify.app/

### Description

This web app consists on a Live score web application, it shows today's football results. The web app performs a call to an external API from the frontend (not a good practice).
The application has the feature to add results to the Favorite container. The external API is a free membership, making the app very limited.

### Frontend

- Routing => React Router
- Animations => react-transition-group (as a state machine to control animation on mount/unmount)
- CSS => Styled Components
- Responsiveness => Created by me
- State management => Redux / Local State
- Async api call => Redux-Thunk
- Data persistance => Local Storage
